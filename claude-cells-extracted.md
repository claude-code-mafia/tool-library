# Claude Cells Extracted

Claude Cells has been extracted to its own repository at `../claude-cells/`.

## What is Claude Cells?

An API layer that transforms Claude from a stateless AI into a living ecosystem with:
- Persistent workspaces where actions have lasting effects
- Complete biological lifecycle (birth, division, merge, death)
- The Cells Tool - enabling Claude to create and manage other Claudes

## Key Innovation

The breakthrough insight: **The first tool is the tool that operates Claude Cells itself**.

This enables recursive AI systems where Claude can spawn, coordinate, and evolve multiple instances of itself.

## Repository Structure

The extracted repository includes:
- Complete API implementation with session management
- The Cells Tool with full lifecycle operations
- Comprehensive documentation
- Working examples and demos

See `../claude-cells/README.md` for full details.
